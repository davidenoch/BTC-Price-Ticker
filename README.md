# BTC-Price-Ticker
AHK script to find the current average BTC price and add it to the clipboard.
I basically got tired of navigating to a web page to get the btc price. 
It is very unsophisticated. I wanted to do it right now without gaining any knowledge.
It opens up the chrome web broser to a URL which gives a text file with just the price of BTC.
It copies this price to the clipboard and displays the price in a message box when you press control-b.
This is basically an exercise for me to get used to using git and to improve my coding practices
